# battleship Reflection 
1. Iteration 3 did not provide an interaction pattern. How did you approach designing this iteration?
   
After reviewing iteration 3, I used the functionality checklist to create a rough outline of methods within my play.rb. The outline allowed me to enable the game to run from my main.rb. From there, I began filling out the methods. I wrote in temporary code to force play through on the methods I hadn’t gotten to yet, to allow for testing. Once thoroughly tested with user input and input written into the code. I switched over to input in the code for the completed method for efficiency sake as I continued to test for the following methods. As I renamed methods, I updated my main.rb accordingly. 

2.. If you had one more day to work on this project, what would you work on?
   
While my game plays all the way through, I did notice that it ends once a single ship has been sunk. Ideally, I would run the game with show_ships = true for the computer_board to rule out the possibility that the computer is only placing 1 ship. Once that could be ruled out, I review my method defining end_game and any methods used within. After, I’d like to focus on cleaning up my code. I think I could learn a lot from reviewing, refactoring, and editing to improve readability. Additionally, I believe a cleaner look and increased code familiarity will be the ideal starting point for Iteration 4.

3. Describe the pairing techniques you used while working on this project.
   
Driver/Navigator and Ping-Pong techniques were implemented when pair programming. 

4. Describe how feedback was shared over the course of this project.
   
The majority of feedback on code was via calls. Feed back via pull requests was scarce as most errors were dealt with verbally as they occurred.
